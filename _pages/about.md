I am a 3rd-year computer science student (at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/)) with a lot of passion for developing his analytical and quantitative skills and a quick learner. I am currently pursuing a degree in a bachelor of science m more specifically, a major in Computer Science and minor in Data Science.

I have provided links to my social media below if you want to contact me.
